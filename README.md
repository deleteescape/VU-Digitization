# VU-Digitization
This repository contains all used datasets for a small DA project for Digitization: From Object To Data at the Vrije Universiteit of Amsterdam.

The repository contains three datasets. Each one is used to answer a different main question of the research. It is based on the <a href="https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2016-10-facebook-fact-check">"Fact-Checking Facebook Politics Pages"</a> dataset made by Buzzfeed. More info on how the data was edited, see the project report.
